### **Private On-Chain Orderbook — Enforced With Zama FHE**

_CipherBook enables fully private order placement and matching on-chain using Fully Homomorphic Encryption._

_Order prices, amounts, and matching logic remain encrypted at all times — even from the blockchain itself._

**Only correctness is revealed. Never the data.**

## 🌟 Overview

**CipherBook** is a **privacy-preserving on-chain orderbook** built using **Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.

In traditional DEXs and orderbooks:
- Prices are public  
- Amounts are public  
- Order strategies are visible  
- MEV and front-running are inevitable  

CipherBook changes this.

Using **Zama FHE**, CipherBook allows **order placement, comparison, and matching to happen directly on encrypted values**, without ever revealing sensitive trade data.

> **Even the blockchain cannot see your order prices or amounts.**

---

## 🧠 Why CipherBook Matters

Public orderbooks leak information.

This leads to:
- Front-running
- Strategy copying
- MEV extraction
- Unfair markets

Most “private” systems today:
- Encrypt data off-chain
- Decrypt it for execution
- Rely on trusted relayers or sequencers

That breaks trust.

**CipherBook enforces privacy directly on-chain.**

- Orders are encrypted
- Matching logic runs on ciphertext
- Smart contracts never see plaintext
- Execution correctness is verifiable

This is **true on-chain privacy**, not an illusion.

## 🔐 Why We Chose Zama FHE

Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows:

- 🔒 Computation on encrypted data  
- 🧮 Encrypted price comparison  
- 🛡️ Protection from MEV & front-running  
- 🌐 Privacy on a public blockchain  

CipherBook demonstrates how **FHE can unlock a new class of DeFi primitives** that were previously impossible on transparent ledgers.

This project is built to **showcase Zama FHE in a real DeFi context**, not a toy example.

## ✨ What CipherBook Enables

- Place BUY / SELL orders with encrypted price & amount
- Store orders fully on-chain
- Compare encrypted prices for matching
- Find valid matches without revealing values
- Confirm matches and mark orders as filled
- Cancel open orders
- Maintain a private yet verifiable order lifecycle

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Client (React + Vite)

Handles:
- Wallet connection
- User input
- Encrypted order submission
- Encrypted match discovery
- Match confirmation

No sensitive data is ever revealed in the UI.

---

### 2. Smart Contract (Solidity + Zama FHE)

Responsible for:
- Storing encrypted orders
- Tracking order status (OPEN / FILLED / CANCELLED)
- Performing encrypted comparisons
- Enforcing valid matches

The contract **never decrypts** any order data.

---

### 3. Blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia)

- Public settlement layer
- Private computation layer via FHE
- Verifiable correctness
- No trust assumptions

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1️⃣ **User places an order**  
→ Price & amount are encrypted  
→ Order stored on-chain  

2️⃣ **User searches for matches**  
→ Contract compares encrypted values  
→ Valid matches are returned  

3️⃣ **User confirms a match**  
→ Orders are marked as filled  
→ No price or amount is revealed  

4️⃣ **Order lifecycle remains private**  
→ Only status is public  
→ Data stays encrypted forever

## 🏗️ System Architecture

CipherBook is a **privacy-preserving on-chain orderbook** built using **Zama’s FHEVM**, where **order details remain encrypted at all times**, yet can still be matched correctly on-chain.

Unlike traditional DEXs, CipherBook ensures that **price, amount, and order intent are never revealed publicly**, preventing front-running, MEV, and order-flow leakage.
